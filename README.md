A website for Hilltop B&amp;B. Created by Sara McCarney and Thomas Wickham.


## Development
For google maps to run locally, a Google API Key needs to be declared as an env variable in a `.env` file at the root of the directory. 

`REACT_APP_API_KEY={"Enter your API key here"}`

To run the app locally, run:
`npm install && npm start`


## Deployment
Pushing to master automatically deploys a build of master code to the domain. Alternatively, run:

`npm run deploy`
